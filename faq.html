<h4 class="bordertop"><a name="faq01" id="faq01"></a>How does the site work?</h4>
<p>You can look through baby gear lists that other people have created, or build your own list. First, you will take a quiz so that we can get some information on the type of parent you hope to be (or are already!). Then we’ll use that information to build you a personalized list of baby gear with or without actual product recommendations (you can decide this during the quiz). You can then customize your list using recommendations from other parents, use it to track your purchases, and share your experience using these products with other parents by rating and reviewing the products you’ve used.</p>

<h4><a name="faq02" id="faq02"></a>How do you select the products you recommend?</h4>
<p>Our team specially curates the products we recommend using the information you give us on your quiz, our own expertise as parents, advice from Mamajamas members, and Amazon user reviews. We update our recommendations frequently. We only promote things we love, and do not receive ANY compensation from baby product companies to promote their gear. </p>

<h4><a name="faq03" id="faq03"></a>Why do you initially only recommend products listed on Amazon?</h4>
<p>Right now, we can only display products that Amazon has on their site. It’s part of that whole “being in <dfn title="'beta' is a term often used in reference to pre-release software that is still undergoing development">beta</dfn>” thing. We’re working to incorporate products from other vendors. And you can always add any product you want, from any website, to your list by clicking the “add your own manually” link from the “choose a product” pop-up window (modal screen). </p>

<p>We may sometimes enter into partnerships with service providers or companies whose product and services we would use ourselves, but we would only do this with a company or service that we would recommend independently, and we don’t let partnership opportunities influence our recommendations, only vice versa.</p>

<h4><a name="faq04" id="faq04"></a>How do you decide the priority of the baby gear you recommend?</h4>
<p>Again, our team curates these based on your quiz selections, their own experiences and the collective experience of Mamajamas members. As a general philosophy, we tend to think there are very few “must have” items. We really want to help you buy less stuff you don’t really need and feel less overwhelmed!</p>

<h4><a name="faq05" id="faq05"></a>Can I add any product I want to my list?</h4>
<p>Yes. Just click the “add your own manually” link from the “choose a product” modal screen (pop-up window). Then you can add the name of the product you want to add and a link to where someone could find the product you need (or are recommending). If you want, you can upload a picture of the product, too.</p>

<h4><a name="faq06" id="faq06"></a>Are the ratings displayed on the "choose" pop-up based on Mamajamas member ratings, or based on Amazon ratings?</h4>
<p>Those are Mamajamas member ratings. You will need to click through to the Amazon page of a product to see the Amazon ratings (their rules, not ours!). </p>

<h4><a name="faq07" id="faq07"></a>How can I see all the reviews for a product?</h4>
<p>We’re working on this. For now, you would need to browse through the lists of Mamajamas members to read all of the reviews.</p>

<h4><a name="faq08" id="faq08"></a>Who can see my list?</h4>
<p>When you save your list, you can choose to make your list visible to everyone, only to Mamajamas users, or private. There is also an option to display just the things you need, like a registry.</p>

<h4><a name="faq09" id="faq09"></a>What is the best way to share my list with others?</h4>
<p>First, you must save your list using the “save” button located on the top right side of your Edit List page. Once you save your list, you can either send out your unique link (like mine here: <a href="http://www.mamajamas.com/angie">www.mamajamas.com/angie</a>) or use the share buttons provided on the top right corner of your shared list page. Please note that some users who use the AdBlock plus browser extension may not be able to see the share buttons. Those users should turn off the plugin’s “block social sharing links” option in order to use the share buttons. </p>

<h4><a name="faq10" id="faq10"></a>Is there a way to import an Excel spreadsheet or list I already have created into a Mamajamas list?</h4>
<p>Not yet, but if you create a Mamajamas account, and then email us your list, we’ll happily upload it for you. Just send it to: <a href="mailto:info@mamajamas.com">info@mamajamas.com</a>.</p>
