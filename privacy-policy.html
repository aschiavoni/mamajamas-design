			<h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
			<p>We collect information in two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.</h4>
					<p>When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile photo, list items, ratings, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. </p>
					<p>You also may enable us to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or other accounts to Mamajamas, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>We get technical information when you use our products. </h4>
					<p>When you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way.</p>
					<p><strong>Log Data</strong>. When you use Mamajamas, our servers record information about your interaction with our products (&quot;log data&quot;), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you use it to access Mamajamas. This log data may include information such as your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Mamajamas, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used Mamajamas.</p>
					<p>Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use &quot;cookies&quot; (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Mamajamas account or your browser), web beacons or flash cookies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use &quot;session&quot; cookies (that last until you close your browser) or &quot;persistent&quot; cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Mamajamas settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Mamajamas.</p>
					<p><strong>Device Information</strong>. In addition to log and cookie data, we may also collect information about the device you're using Mamajamas on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>How do we use the information we collect?</h3>
			<p>We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, develop new products, and protect Mamajamas and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better.</p>
			<p>We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content â€” including helping you find products you might like or provide you with tailored advertising. For example, if you've indicated that you live in a certain zip code, we may suggest baby gear that is often used by people in your zip code.</p>
			<h3>What choices do you have about your information?</h3>
			<p>Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a Mamajamas account, many of the choices you have on Mamajamas are built directly in to the product or your account settings. For example, you can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Access and change information in your <a href="http://www.mamajamas.com/profile/">profile page</a> at any time.</li>
				<li>Link or unlink your Mamajamas account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Mamajamas to that service.</li>
				<li>Choose whether or not to share your list publicly.</li>
				<li>Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it and remove your list items from Mamajamas. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam). </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>We also use the information we collect to:</h3>
			<p>Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like a new person following your list, happens on Mamajamas), newsletters, marketing materials, and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you weekly updates that include products you may like. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide).</p>
			<p>The information we collect may be &quot;personally identifiable&quot; (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or &quot;non-personally identifiable&quot; (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever Mamajamas does business, including countries outside your own.</p>
			<p>You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Mamajamas. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage.;</li>
				<li>Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us.</li>
				<li>To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>How do we share the information we collect?</h3>
			<p>Mamajamas is a tool to help new parents organize all of the gear they need for their children. When you create a public list, anyone can view it. You may also provide us with profile page information that that anyone can view. The other limited instances where we may share your personal information include:</p>
			<p>When we have your consent. This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you&rsquo;ve chosen to link to your Mamajamas account to those services or publish your activity on Mamajamas to them. For example, you can choose to publish your pins to Facebook or Twitter.</p>
			<p>We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam or with our accountants to make sure we&rsquo;re keeping the books right. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. </p>
			<p>We may share your information Iif we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Mamajamas; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</p>
			<p>We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.</p>
			<p>We partner with certain third parties to collect and analyze the cookie and log information discussed above. These third parties may use web logs or set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, Mamajamas uses Google Analytics for the purposes discussed above. The use of cookies and other tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, you may set your browser to block cookies. And you may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">here</a>.</p>
			<h3>How do we make changes to this policy?</h3>
			<p>We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we&rsquo;ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Mamajamas after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law.</p>
