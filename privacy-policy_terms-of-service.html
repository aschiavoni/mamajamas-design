        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <div class="tabbody">
          <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
          <p>We collect information in two ways:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.</h4>
              <p>When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile photo, list items, ratings, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. </p>
              <p>You also may enable us to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or other accounts to Mamajamas, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>We get technical information when you use our products. </h4>
              <p>When you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way.</p>
              <p><strong>Log Data</strong>. When you use Mamajamas, our servers record information about your interaction with our products (&quot;log data&quot;), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you use it to access Mamajamas. This log data may include information such as your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Mamajamas, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used Mamajamas.</p>
              <p>Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use &quot;cookies&quot; (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Mamajamas account or your browser), web beacons or flash cookies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use &quot;session&quot; cookies (that last until you close your browser) or &quot;persistent&quot; cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Mamajamas settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Mamajamas.</p>
              <p><strong>Device Information</strong>. In addition to log and cookie data, we may also collect information about the device you're using Mamajamas on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>How do we use the information we collect?</h3>
          <p>We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, develop new products, and protect Mamajamas and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better.</p>
          <p>We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content â€” including helping you find products you might like or provide you with tailored advertising. For example, if you've indicated that you live in a certain zip code, we may suggest baby gear that is often used by people in your zip code.</p>
          <h3>What choices do you have about your information?</h3>
          <p>Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a Mamajamas account, many of the choices you have on Mamajamas are built directly in to the product or your account settings. For example, you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access and change information in your <a href="http://www.mamajamas.com/profile/">profile page</a> at any time.</li>
            <li>Link or unlink your Mamajamas account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Mamajamas to that service.</li>
            <li>Choose whether or not to share your list publicly.</li>
            <li>Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it and remove your list items from Mamajamas. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam). </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>We also use the information we collect to:</h3>
          <p>Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like a new person following your list, happens on Mamajamas), newsletters, marketing materials, and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you weekly updates that include products you may like. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide).</p>
          <p>The information we collect may be &quot;personally identifiable&quot; (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or &quot;non-personally identifiable&quot; (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever Mamajamas does business, including countries outside your own.</p>
          <p>You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Mamajamas. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage.;</li>
            <li>Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us.</li>
            <li>To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider. </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How do we share the information we collect?</h3>
          <p>Mamajamas is a tool to help new parents organize all of the gear they need for their children. When you create a public list, anyone can view it. You may also provide us with profile page information that that anyone can view. The other limited instances where we may share your personal information include:</p>
          <p>When we have your consent. This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you&rsquo;ve chosen to link to your Mamajamas account to those services or publish your activity on Mamajamas to them. For example, you can choose to publish your pins to Facebook or Twitter.</p>
          <p>We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam or with our accountants to make sure we&rsquo;re keeping the books right. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. </p>
          <p>We may share your information Iif we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Mamajamas; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</p>
          <p>We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.</p>
          <p>We partner with certain third parties to collect and analyze the cookie and log information discussed above. These third parties may use web logs or set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, Mamajamas uses Google Analytics for the purposes discussed above. The use of cookies and other tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, you may set your browser to block cookies. And you may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">here</a>.</p>
          <h3>How do we make changes to this policy?</h3>
          <p>We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we&rsquo;ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Mamajamas after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law.</p>

          <h3>8. Disclaimers</h3>
          <p>The Products and all included content are provided on an &quot;as is&quot; basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.</p>
          <p>MAMAJAMAS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.</p>
          <p>Mamajamas takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other user or third party posts or transmits using our Products. </p>
          <p>You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.</p>
          <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MAMAJAMAS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE PRODUCTS; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL MAMAJAMAS'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00).</p>
          <h3>10. Arbitration</h3>
          <p>For any dispute you have with Mamajamas, you agree to first <a href="mailto:info@mamajamas.com">contact us</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If Mamajamas has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Mamajamas agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Mamajamas will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MAMAJAMAS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
          <h3>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
          <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. </p>
          <p>Our Products are controlled and operated from the United States, and we make no representations that they are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>
          <h3>12. General Terms</h3>
          <h4>Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms. </h4>
          <p>Mamajamas reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose. We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you. By continuing to access or use the Products after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Products.</p>
          <h4>Assignment. </h4>
          <p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Mamajamas without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
          <h4>Entire Agreement/Severability. </h4>
          <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Mamajamas in connection with the Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Mamajamas concerning the Products. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
          <h4>No Waiver. </h4>
          <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Mamajamas failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
