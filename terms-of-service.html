					<p><span class="light">Effective date:  November 1, 2013.</span></p>
					<p>Welcome to Mamajamas!  Mamajamas, Inc. (&ldquo;Mamajamas&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, or  &ldquo;our&rdquo;) maintains this website as a service to the user community that visits  the Website subject to these Terms of Service.   By using www.mamajamas.com and its sub-domains, including our platform  for creating product lists of baby gear and communicating with expecting and  new parents  (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;), and the  other services and features made available through the Website and any related  services including any downloadable applications we make available to you from  time to time (collectively with the Website, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), you indicate your  unconditional acceptance of these Terms of Service.  Throughout these Terms of Service, &ldquo;you&rdquo; or  &ldquo;your&rdquo; may refer as applicable to a registered user of our Services or a member  of the general public accessing or using any of our Services (each a  &ldquo;User&rdquo;).</p>
					<p>Please read these Terms of Service  carefully, as they may have changed since your last visit.  We reserve the right to change these Terms of  Service from time to time for any reason, which shall be effected by posting of  the updated Terms of Service to our Website; provided that any such changes  shall only apply to your use of the Services after the date of such change,  unless you expressly accept retroactive application of such changes, via a  click-through or signed agreement or otherwise.   Access to the Website, and use of the Services are subject to these  Terms of Service and the <a href="privacy-policy.html">Mamajamas Privacy Policy</a> available on the Website. </p>
					<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE  CAREFULLY, AS THEY CREATE A BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND MAMAJAMAS.  FURTHER, THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAIN AN  AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH REQUIRES THAT YOU AND MAMAJAMAS ARBITRATE CERTAIN  CLAIMS BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF GOING TO COURT AND LIMITS  CLASS ACTION CLAIMS, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AS  DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION SECTION (SEE SECTION 20 &ldquo;AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE&rdquo;).</p>
					<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
					<p>The Services provide a platform for you to connect and learn from what other expecting and new parents are doing to prepare for the arrival of a baby.  The Services enable users to create profiles, share thoughts, ideas, or comments, and plan and find products that suit their parenting style by communicating with other parents and by creating customized lists of baby-related products (“Lists”).  Mamajamas also enables you to create a customized list of products “your List” through our online questionnaire (the “Questionnaire”) from which you can then add to or remove items by editing your List through our Services.  Users can follow what other parents are doing and share with family, friends, and others who may be interested in what products a parent thinks they may need.  Each registered User can create their own webpage (“User Webpage”) on our Services that other Users may view unless you choose to hide such webpage from other Users.  By helping you spend less time thinking about creating lists of what you will need, we hope to create more time for you to enjoy pregnancy and new parenthood.</p>
					<p>The Services may also enable you to view product reviews and ratings to provide your own reviews and rate particular products (each, a “Review”) to inform other users about your opinion of a product.  Mamajamas does not currently sell products through its website, but does provide links for you if you wish to purchase a product on your List from an online retailer (each, an “Online Store”).</p>
					<h3>2. Scope of Service</h3>
					<p>You may be accessing and using the Services as a registered user or as a member of the general public simply using the functionality, and/or reviewing the content, that is publicly available on the Services.

The Amazon logo is a trademark of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.</p>
					<p> In no event shall any reference to any third party or third party product or service be construed as an approval or endorsement by Mamajamas of that third party or of any product or service provided by a third party.  Likewise, a link (including without limitation external websites that are framed by the Services as well as any advertisements displayed in connection therewith) to any third party Website does not imply that we endorse or accept any responsibility for the content or use of such a website. </p>
					<h3>5. Website  Content; Product Descriptions.</h3>
					<p>We do not currently sell products through our Website, but may do so in the future. We do, however, provide certain information or descriptions about products (collectively "Product Descriptions") that we prepare or that we obtain from independent third parties, such as from third party Online Stores.</p>
					<p>We do not warrant that Product Descriptions or any prices that are referenced are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.  You agree that Mamajamas is not liable in any way for the accuracy, completeness, timeliness or correct sequencing of the Product Descriptions or other Content, or for any decision made or action taken by you relying upon the Product Descriptions or other Content. 
						The term “Content” means all information, text, images, data, links, software, Reviews, Lists, Product Descriptions or other material accessible through the Services, whether created by us or provided by another person, User, or Online Store for display on the Website or through the Services.

Mamajamas may monitor disputes between Users, but is not obligated to monitor, mediate, or resolve such disputes.</p>

					<p>If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” </p>

					<p>Mamajamas services are available only to, and may  only be used by, individuals who are 18 years and older who can form legally  binding contracts under applicable law.   Individuals under the age of 18 can use our Services only in conjunction  with and under the supervision of a parent.   In this case, the parent is responsible for any and all activities of  the User in connection with our Services.  </p>
