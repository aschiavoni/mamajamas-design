      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MAMAJAMAS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE PRODUCTS; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

      <h3>10. Arbitration</h3>
      <p>For any dispute you have with Mamajamas, you agree to first <a href="mailto:info@mamajamas.com">contact us</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If Mamajamas has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Mamajamas agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Mamajamas will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MAMAJAMAS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
      <h3>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. </p>
      <p>Our Products are controlled and operated from the United States, and we make no representations that they are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>
      <h3>12. General Terms</h3>
      <h4>Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms. </h4>
      <p>Mamajamas reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose. We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you. By continuing to access or use the Products after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Products.</p>
      <h4>Assignment. </h4>
      <p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Mamajamas without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
      <h4>Entire Agreement/Severability. </h4>
      <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Mamajamas in connection with the Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Mamajamas concerning the Products. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
      <h4>No Waiver. </h4>
      <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Mamajamas failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
